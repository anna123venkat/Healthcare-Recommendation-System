## Overview
The Healthcare Recommendation System is designed to assist users in identifying potential diseases based on symptoms and providing personalized recommendations for medications, diets, workouts, and precautions. 

It integrates a Flask-based web application with a Spark-powered backend for real-time predictions and efficient data processing. 

## Features
- **Symptom-based Disease Prediction**: Predict diseases using a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier.
- **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Descriptions of the predicted disease.
  - Suggested medications, diets, workouts, and precautions.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly interface powered by Flask.
- **Scalable Backend**: Utilizes Apache Spark for processing large datasets efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML with Jinja2 templating (via Flask).
- **Backend**:
  - Flask for web services.
  - Apache Spark for machine learning and data processing.
  - Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Pickle.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Random Forest Classifier for disease prediction.
  - PySpark's MLlib for building and evaluating the model.
- **Datasets**:
  - Symptom-disease relationships.
  - Disease-specific medications, diets, precautions, and workouts.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Spark
- Flask
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install flask pyspark pandas numpy
  ```

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Healthcare-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Healthcare-Recommendation-System
   ```
2. Prepare the datasets:
   - Place the CSV files in the `datasets/` directory.
3. Train the model (if needed):
   ```bash
